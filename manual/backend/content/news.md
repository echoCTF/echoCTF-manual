# News

Manage news items and (optionally) post on a discord webhook.

These news items are displayed by default on the frontend dashboard page.

The listing displays the following fields:

* `ID`: The unique ID of the entry
* `Title`: The title of the news item
* `Category`: A category for the entry. It supports HTML so you can use images such as `<img src="/images/news/category/target-migration.svg" width="25px" alt="">`
* `Created At`/`Updated At`: A date showing when the new item was created and when was the last time it got updated.
