# Challenges

Challenges test your offensive and defensive security skills across a wide range of real-world scenarios. Each challenge contains one or more questions, often increasing in difficulty as you progress. Your mission is to investigate the provided artifacts, extract the right information, and submit the correct answers.

Challenges cover a variety of cybersecurity disciplines. You may be asked to:

* **Examine a filesystem image** to uncover hidden, deleted, or tampered files
* **Audit a server disk image** and identify all known CVEs affecting the installation
* **Perform forensic investigations** on compromised systems by retracing attacker activity, discovering backdoors, and identifying attack vectors
* **Reverse engineer binaries** to extract hidden information, understand program behavior, or locate embedded secrets

This list isn’t exhaustive. New challenges can appear at any time.
