## Key Elements on the Targets Listing Page

### Header Functionality
  - The **search bar** at the top allows you to search for a target by its name.
  - The **Submit a Flag** button, located prominently in the top-right corner of the header, is a core feature of the EchoCTF.RED platform. This button provides a quick and accessible way to submit captured flags you have found during your interaction with a target.

  
### Stats
At the top of the Targets Page, you can view your progress with the following metrics:
  - **Flags**: Total number of flags captured.
  - **Services**: Number of unique services found and identified.

- **Target**: The name of the target. You can sort the targets by their name in ascending or descending order by clicking on the "Target" column header.
- **IP**: The assigned virtual IP address of the target.  Machines displaying the IP address 0.0.0.0 **must be powered on** before they can be interacted with. This ensures resources are allocated for the challenge. Detailed instructions on how to power a machine will be provided later in this manual.
- **Book Icon**: Indicates that the target has associated writeups available for reference.

- **Flags Icon**: Shows the total number of flags available on the target and keeps count of how many you have successfully captured.
- **Skull Icon**: The number of users who have headshoted a target.
- **Progress**: A visual progress bar indicating the completion level for each target.
- **Actions**:
  - **Eye Icon**: Click to view more details about the target.
  - **Twitter Icon**: Share the target progress on Twitter.

# Target Page
The Target Page provides detailed information about a specific target, including its status, metrics, and activity. It allows you to focus on individual targets, track their progress, and interact with available resources and activities.

To access a specific target, click on its **name** or the **Eye Icon** on the target listing page.

At the top of the page, a notification highlights the current state of the target. If you are not connected to the VPN the following message appears: "This target is currently powered off. Connect to the VPN to be allowed to power the system up."

## Power Up a Target
Powering up a target is a crucial step before you can interact with it. This feature ensures that the system allocates resources for the specific target and prepares it for exploitation. Follow the steps below to successfully power up a target.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before attempting to power up a target, you must first connect to the EchoCTF.RED VPN. Without the VPN connection, the option to power up a target will not be available.

Once connected to the VPN you will see a "Target is currently powered off" message at the top of the page, indicating that the target is not active yet and needs to be powered on.

![Target Powered Off Message](../.gitbook/assets/target_powered_off_message.png)

**Steps to power up a target**:
1. Locate and click the **gears icon**.
2. Select the **Power up this target** option.

![Power up a target](../.gitbook/assets/power_up_target.png)

3. A popup message will appear informing you that the target is about to be powered up.
>[!NOTE]
> Once powered up, the target becomes accessible to all users.
4. Click **OK** to proceed.
5. A notification will confirm that the target is in the power-up queue.
6. Shortly after, another notification will appear, indicating that the target has been successfully powered up.
7. Refresh the target's page to see the status update. A countdown timer will appear at the top of the page, showing the elapsed time until the target is automatically shut down.

## Spawn a Target
To spawn a target, click on the settings icon and click on spawn private instance.

The machines that already have  their IP addresses allocated have already been spawned so you don't need a private instance to access them.
